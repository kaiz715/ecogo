A ridesharing application that allows people going to the same event to carpool and save energy. This application aims to match people that are close to each other and are going to the same event.

We save information about the event and ride shares on a SQL database and access it through sqlalchemy. We used flask (python) as a backend with raw html/css/js as a front end. We also tried to use google maps's api to find the distance between two users and use that in our reconmondations of who to carpool with.
